📚 ML Prediction Project

Check Commits : Add new Machine Learning project to new branch

This project demonstrates the implementation of machine learning algorithms focused on:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for Image Clustering

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for General Prediction Tasks

Both models are built from scratch and aim to provide an intuitive understanding of KNN concepts.

🚀 Project Features

🖼️ KNN Image Clustering:

Clusters similar images into groups based on pixel intensity or feature vectors.

Demonstrates how KNN can be adapted for unsupervised-style image analysis.

📊 KNN Prediction Algorithm:

Implements a supervised KNN algorithm for classification and regression tasks.

Predicts the class or value for unseen data points by finding the nearest neighbors in the training set.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualization)
