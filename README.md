# Dataset-Analysis-and-Prediction
Dataset Analysis using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Clustering

📌 Overview
This project demonstrates dataset analysis using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering algorithm. The goal is to classify data points into different clusters based on their feature similarity. The implementation includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, distance computation, and cluster assignment using KNN.

📂 Features
✅ Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.

✅ KNN Implementation – Using distance-based clustering for pattern recognition.

✅ Elbow Method – Finding the optimal number of clusters.

✅ Data Visualization – Graphical representation of clustered data points.

✅ Evaluation Metrics – Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification problems.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains multiple attributes/features used to classify data points into different groups. Example datasets include:

Iris Dataset (Flower classification)
Customer Segmentation Dataset
Handwritten Digits Dataset (MNIST)
Any other real-world dataset

🏗️ How It Works

Load the dataset and explore its structure.

Preprocess the data (handle missing values, standardization, etc.).

Apply the KNN algorithm to classify data points into clusters.

Use the Elbow Method to determine the best value for K.

Visualize the clusters using scatter plots or heatmaps.

Evaluate performance using accuracy metrics.
