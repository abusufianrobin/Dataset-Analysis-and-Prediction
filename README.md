📚 Naive Bayes Prediction Project

Check Commits : 

This project applies the Naive Bayes classification algorithm to solve two real-world prediction tasks:

Playing Tennis Prediction

Dhaka Weather Prediction

The models are implemented from scratch to demonstrate how Naive Bayes works with categorical and numerical features.

🚀 Project Features

🏸 Playing Tennis Prediction:

Predicts whether a person will play tennis based on weather conditions such as outlook, temperature, humidity, and wind.

Uses categorical data and applies Naive Bayes classification logic.

🌦️ Dhaka Weather Prediction:

Predicts future weather conditions (Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy) in Dhaka city based on past weather attributes like humidity, temperature, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.

Works with numerical and categorical inputs.
