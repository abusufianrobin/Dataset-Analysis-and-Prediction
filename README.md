ðŸ“š Email Spam Detection Using Logistic Regression Assignemnt 

Check commit : Logistic regression model for email-spam checking 

Dataset name : email.csv

Iteration Accuracy report added, Quyestion Added . 

This project implements a Logistic Regression model from scratch to classify emails as Spam or Not Spam based on the frequency of commonly used words.

ðŸš€ Project Features

ðŸ“© Spam vs Non-Spam Email Classification:

Predicts whether an email is spam (label 1) or not spam (label 0).

Trains a logistic regression model using a dataset of emails represented as word frequency vectors.

ðŸ“ˆ Custom Logistic Regression Model:

Built without using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

Implements the core concepts of logistic regression:

Sigmoid function

Cross-entropy loss

Gradient descent optimization

Feature normalization

ðŸ“Š Visualization:

Plots the cost function versus the number of iterations for different learning rates.

Helps understand model convergence behavior.
